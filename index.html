          <h3>Dear customers</h3>

          <p>
            Ben and I started Thread 10 years ago with the goal of making it
            easier for men and women to dress well. To achieve this we pioneered
            how to combine cutting-edge AI with expert stylists, to give each
            person the perfect set of recommendations.
            <br /><br />
            One of our biggest partners along the way was M&amp;S, who shared
            our vision for democratising style. To help bring this to their much
            larger audience, they have acquired Thread's brand, technology and
            data.
            <br /><br />
            This news is bittersweet, as unfortunately we will be stopping
            trading independently. We are going to miss working with you all.
            Thank you for all of the support you have shown us over the years by
            shopping with us.
            <br /><br />
            Warmest regards,
            <br /><br />
            Kieran &amp; Ben<br />

        <h3>Common Questions</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h4>What has happened?</h4>
          <p>
            Marks &amp; Spencer has acquired Thread’s brand, technology and
            data, in order to integrate the functionality into its customer
            offering. They have not acquired the rest of the business, so we
            will unfortunately have to cease trading and put the business into
            administration. We understand how disappointing this may be. If you
            have a question, read the common questions below, and if it’s not
            covered feel free to contact our customer support team.

            I have placed an order but I have not received my item(s). What can

          <p>
            Thread is now regrettably in administration and has ceased trading.
            Unfortunately, we are therefore not able to ship any further orders
            or process any cancellations. If you have paid for your item(s) but
            not received your order, it may be possible to recover this amount
            via your credit/debit card provider by making a Chargeback claim or,
            if the price of the item(s) you bought is higher than £100, by
            exercising your rights against your credit card provider under
            Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. You should be able to
            find more details about this process at the link below:

            While we appreciate it’s disappointing, we can’t offer refunds or
            exchanges and we are not taking returns. Thread is no longer trading
            and unfortunately that means we are not able to process returns and
            issue refunds. Please do not return your goods as we are not able to
            process them and cannot guarantee they would be returned to you. You
            may be entitled to make a claim via your debit/credit card provider.

            We understand it may cause frustration but unfortunately, as Thread
            has ceased trading, we are unable to offer exchanges and we are not
            taking returns. If your item arrived faulty, you may be entitled to
            a make a claim against the manufacturer if the product has a
            warranty, or make a claim via your debit/credit card provider. You

          <h4>I have a gift card. Is this valid?</h4>
          <p>
            Sadly, Thread is no longer trading so unfortunately that means gift
            cards for our website are no longer valid. If your gift card was
            purchased via a debit/credit card, it may be possible to make a
            claim via the card provider that was used to purchase it. You can
